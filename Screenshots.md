So far, Parti is not usable as an actual WM, so we have screencasts demoing parts of the tech.  (All are in theora format.)



  * [Screencast 1](http://vorpus.org/~njs/parti/demo-1.ogg): doing window management with a simple two-paned tabbed layout using stock GTK widgets. Also demonstrates pulling up a Python REPL running inside the live WM, letting you mess around with its internal structures for fun and... well, fun, mostly.

  * [Screencast 2](http://vorpus.org/~njs/parti/demo-2.ogg): another demo, of the new compositing functionality.  (Yes, Parti is a compositing window manager.)  The interesting thing to notice here, aside from the coolness factor, is how little code is needed to create this layout: [46 lines](http://code.google.com/p/partiwm/source/browse/parti/trays/compositetest.py).
