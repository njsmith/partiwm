# PLEASE NOTE #

This project is in deep hibernation; I haven't had time to devote for several years now.

If you are looking for xpra, you may prefer Antoine Martin's fork, which receives more support. It is available at: http://xpra.org/

# Original page follows #

Xpra gives you "persistent remote applications" for X.  That is, unlike normal X applications, applications run with xpra are "persistent" -- you can run them remotely, and they don't die if your connection does.  You can detach them, and reattach them later -- even from another computer -- with no loss of state.  And unlike VNC or RDP, xpra is for remote applications, not remote desktops -- individual applications show up as individual windows on your screen, managed by your window manager.  They're not trapped in a box.



So basically it's [screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) for remote X apps.



Xpra is currently ~beta status.  It's a bit crude -- various polish-y features are unimplemented, and most error reporting includes tracebacks -- but it is usable for real work.



Xpra is included in the combined wimpiggy/parti/xpra releases.  For more details, see the [xpra FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/partiwm/source/browse/README.xpra), or go straight to the [download directory](http://code.google.com/p/partiwm/downloads/list).  Discussion should be directed to [parti-discuss](http://lists.partiwm.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/parti-discuss).
