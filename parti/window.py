    # A few words about _NET_WM_STATE are in order.  Basically, it is a set of
    # flags.  Clients are allowed to set the initial value of this X property
    # to anything they like, when their window is first mapped; after that,
    # though, only the window manager is allowed to touch this property.  So
    # we store its value (our at least, our idea as to its value, the X server
    # in principle could disagree) as the "state" property.  There are
    # basically two things we need to accomplish:
    #   1) Whenever our property is modified, we mirror that modification into
    #      the X server.  This is done by connecting to our own notify::state
    #      signal.
    #   2) As a more user-friendly interface to these state flags, we provide
    #      several boolean properties like "attention-requested".
    #      These are virtual boolean variables; they are actually backed
    #      directly by the "state" property, and reading/writing them in fact
    #      accesses the "state" set directly.  This is done by overriding

    # to anything they like, when their window is first mapped; after that,
    # though, only the window manager is allowed to touch this property.  So
    # we store its value (our at least, our idea as to its value, the X server
    # in principle could disagree) as the "state" property.  There are
    # basically two things we need to accomplish:
    #   1) Whenever our property is modified, we mirror that modification into
    #      the X server.  This is done by connecting to our own notify::state
    #      signal.
