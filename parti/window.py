# Each box in this diagram represents one X/GDK window.  In the common case,
# every window here takes up exactly the same space on the screen (!).  In
# fact, the two windows on the right *always* have exactly the same size and
# location, and the window on the left and the top window also always have
# exactly the same size and position.  However, each window in the diagram
# plays a subtly different role.
#
# The client window is obvious -- this is the window owned by the client,
# which they created and which we have various ICCCM/EWMH-mandated
# responsibilities towards.  It is also composited.
#
# The purpose of the 'corral' is to keep the client window managed -- we
# select for SubstructureRedirect on it, so that the client cannot resize
# etc. without going through the WM.
#
# These two windows are always managed together, as a unit; an invariant of
# the code is that they always take up exactly the same space on the screen.
# They get reparented back and forth between widgets, and when there are no
# widgets, they get reparented to a "parking area".  For now, we're just using
# the root window as a parking area, so we also map/unmap the expose window
# depending on whether we are parked or not; the corral and client windows are
# left mapped at all times.
#
# When a particular WindowView controls the underlying client window, then two
# things happen:
#   -- Its size determines the size of the client window.  Ideally they are
#      the same size -- but this is not always the case, because the client
#      may have specified sizing constraints, in which case the client window
#      is the "best fit" to the controlling widget window.
#   -- The client window and its corral are reparented under the widget
#      window, as in the diagram above.  This is necessary to allow mouse
#      events to work -- a WindowView widget can always *look* like the client
#      window is there, through the magic of Composite, but in order for it to
#      *act* like the client window is there in terms of receiving mouse
#      events, it has to actually be there.
#
# Finally, there is the 'image' window.  This is a window that always remains
# in the widget window, and is used to draw what the client currently looks
# like.  It needs to receive endogenous expose events so it knows if it has
# been literally exposed (not just when the window it is displaying has
# changed), and the easiest way to arrange for this is to make it exactly the
# same size as the parent 'widget' window.  Then the widget window never
# receives expose events (because it is occluded), and we can arrange for the
# image window's expose events to be delivered to the WindowView widget, and
# they will be in the right coordinate space.  If the widget is controlling
# the client, then the image window goes on top of the client window.  Why
# don't we just draw onto the widget window?  Because there is no way to ask
# Cairo to use IncludeInferiors drawing mode -- so if we were drawing onto the
# widget window, and the client were present in the widget window, then the
# blank black 'expose catcher' window would obscure the image of the client.
#
# All clear?

    # A few words about _NET_WM_STATE are in order.  Basically, it is a set of
    # flags.  Clients are allowed to set the initial value of this X property
    # to anything they like, when their window is first mapped; after that,
    # though, only the window manager is allowed to touch this property.  So
    # we store its value (or at least, our idea as to its value, the X server
    # in principle could disagree) as the "state" property.  There are
    # basically two things we need to accomplish:
    #   1) Whenever our property is modified, we mirror that modification into
    #      the X server.  This is done by connecting to our own notify::state
    #      signal.
    #   2) As a more user-friendly interface to these state flags, we provide
    #      several boolean properties like "attention-requested".
    #      These are virtual boolean variables; they are actually backed
    #      directly by the "state" property, and reading/writing them in fact
    #      accesses the "state" set directly.  This is done by overriding
