# This file defines Parti's top-level widget.  It is a magic window that
# always and exactly covers the entire screen (possibly crossing multiple
# screens, in the Xinerama case); it also mediates between the GTK+ and X
# focus models.
# 
# This requires a very long comment, because focus management is teh awesome.
# The basic problems are:
#    1) X focus management sucks
#    2) GDK/GTK know this, and sensible avoid it
# (1) is a problem by itself, but (2) makes it worse, because we have to wedge
# them together somehow anyway.
#
# In more detail: X tracks which X-level window has (keyboard) focus at each
# point in time.  This is the window which receives KeyPress and KeyRelease
# events.  GTK also has a notion of focus; at any given time (within a
# particular toplevel) exactly one widget is focused.  This is the widget
# which receives key-press-event and key-release-event signals.  However,
# at the level of implementation, these two ideas of focus are actually kept
# entirely separate.  In fact, when a GTK toplevel gets focus, it sets the X
# input focus to a special hidden window, reads X events off of that window,
# and then internally routes these events to whatever the appropriate widget
# would be at any given time.
#
# The other thing which GTK does with focus is simply tweak the drawing style
# of widgets.  A widget that is focused within its toplevel can/will look
# different from a widget that does not have focus within its toplevel.
# Similarly, a widget may look different depending on whether the toplevel
# that contains it has toplevel focus or not.
#
# Unfortunately, we cannot read keyboard events out of the special hidden
# window and route them to client windows; to be a proper window manager, we
# must actually assign X focus to client windows, while pretending to GTK+
# that nothing funny is going on, and our client windows are just ordinary
# widgets.
#
# So there are a few pieces to this.  Firstly, GTK tracks focus on toplevels
# by watching for focus events from X, which ultimately come from the window
# manager.  Since we *are* the window manager, this is not particularly
# useful.  Instead, we create a special subclass of gtk.Window that fills the
# whole screen, and trick GTK into thinking that this toplevel *always* has
# (GTK) focus.
#
# Then, to manage the actual X focus, we do a little dance, watching the GTK
# focus within our special toplevel.  Whenever it moves to a widget that
# actually represents a client window, we send the X focus to that client
# window.  Whenever it moves to a widget that is actually an ordinary widget,
# we take the X focus back to our special toplevel.
#
# Note that this means that we do violate our overall goal of making client
# window widgets indistinguishable from ordinary GTK widgets, because client
# window widgets can only be placed inside this special toplevel, and this
# toplevel has special-cased handling for our particular client-wrapping
# widget.  In practice this should not be a problem.
#
# Finally, we have to notice when the root window gets focused (as it can when
# a client misbehaves, or perhaps exits in a weird way), and regain the
# focus.  The Wm object is actually responsible for doing this (since it is
# responsible for all root-window event handling); we just expose an API
# ('reset_x_focus') that people should call whenever they think that focus may
# have gone wonky.

    # We want to fake GTK out into thinking that this window always has
    # toplevel focus, no matter what happens.  There are two parts to this:
    # (1) getting has-toplevel-focus set to start with, (2) making sure it is
    # never unset.  (2) is easy -- we just override do_focus_out_event to
    # silently swallow all FocusOut events, so we never notice losing the
    # focus.  (1) is harder, because we can't just go ahead and set
    # has-toplevel-focus to true; there is a bunch of other stuff that GTK
    # does from the focus-in-event handler, and we want to do all of that.  To
    # make it worse, we cannot call the focus-in-event handler unless we
    # actually have a GdkEvent to pass it, and PyGtk does not expose any
    # constructor for GdkEvents!  So instead, we:
    #   -- force focus to ourselves for real, once, when becoming visible
    #   -- let the normal GTK machinery handle this first FocusIn
    #      -- it is possible that we should not in fact have the X focus at
    #         this time, though, so then give it to whoever should
    #   -- and finally ignore all subsequent focus-in-events
