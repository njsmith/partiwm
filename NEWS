Parti 0.0.1 (2007-08-10)
========================

Initial release.

Contains basic window manager functionality, including a fair amount
of compliance to ICCCM/EWMH, focus handling, etc., and doesn't seem to
crash in basic testing.

Doesn't do much useful with this; only a simple placeholder layout
manager is included, and only skeleton of virtual desktop support is
yet written.
