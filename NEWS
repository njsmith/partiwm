Parti 0.0.3 (2008-?????)
========================

refactoring
hotkeys
model/view separation for client windows
  compositing
window icon support
better geometry constraint interpretation
redo event plumbing to avoid cross-language reference loops (-> memory
  leaks)
support for STRUT hints (i.e. we can tell how panels work)
added --replace switch
use one X/D-Bus session for running multiple tests -- speeds up test
suite by ~3x, though may be buggy and fragile

Parti 0.0.2 (2007-10-26)
========================

This release adds a mostly comprehensive test suite, plus fixes a lot
of bugs.  Still only useful for experimentation and hacking.

'python setup.py sdist' sort of works now.

Parti 0.0.1 (2007-08-10)
========================

Initial release.

Contains basic window manager functionality, including a fair amount
of compliance to ICCCM/EWMH, focus handling, etc., and doesn't seem to
crash in basic testing.

Doesn't do much useful with this; only a simple placeholder layout
manager is included, and only skeleton of virtual desktop support is
yet written.
