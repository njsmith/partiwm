Parti 0.0.3 (2008-02-20)
========================

Massive refactoring occurred for this release.

wimpiggy: The WM backend parts of Parti have been split off into a
separate package known as wimpiggy.  As compared to the corresponding
code in 0.0.2, wimpiggy 0.0.3 adds:
  -- Compositing support
  -- Model/view separation for client windows (based on compositing
     support)
  -- Improved client hint support, including icon handling, strut
     handling, and more correct geometry handling.
  -- Keybinding support
  -- Event dispatching that doesn't leak memory
  -- Better interaction with already running window managers (i.e., a
     --replace switch as seen in metacity etc.)

parti: This package will eventually become the real window manager,
but for now is essentially a testbed for wimpiggy.

xpra: This is a new, independent program dependent on wimpiggy (which
is why wimpiggy had to be split out).  It implements 'screen for X' --
letting one run applications remotely that can be detached and then
re-attached without losing state.  This is the first release, but
while not perfect, it is substantially usable.

general: The test runner was hacked to share a single X/D-Bus session
across multiple tests.  This speeds up the test suite by a factor of
~3, but seems to be buggy and fragile and may be reverted in the
future.

Parti 0.0.2 (2007-10-26)
========================

This release adds a mostly comprehensive test suite, plus fixes a lot
of bugs.  Still only useful for experimentation and hacking.

'python setup.py sdist' sort of works now.

Parti 0.0.1 (2007-08-10)
========================

Initial release.

Contains basic window manager functionality, including a fair amount
of compliance to ICCCM/EWMH, focus handling, etc., and doesn't seem to
crash in basic testing.

Doesn't do much useful with this; only a simple placeholder layout
manager is included, and only skeleton of virtual desktop support is
yet written.
