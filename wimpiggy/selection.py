# According to ICCCM 2.8/4.3, a window manager for screen N is a client which
# acquires the selection WM_S<N>.  If another client already has this
# selection, we can either abort or steal it.  Once we have it, if someone
# else steals it, then we should exit.

# Standards BUG: ICCCM 2.8 specifies exactly how we are supposed to do the
# detection/stealing stuff, and we totally ignore it, because G[TD]K don't
# make it convenient to 1) ask directly whether a selection is owned, 2) wait
# for a window to be destroyed.  So instead, we detect if the selection is
# owned by trying to convert it, and if it is we either abort or simply steal
# the selection and assume things will work out.
