# We use two sockets to talk to the child, rather than 1 socket, or 2 pipes,
# because on Windows:
#   1) You can only call select() on sockets
#   2) If you want to pass a socket as a child process's stdin/stdout, then
#      that socket must *not* have WSA_FLAG_OVERLAPPED set.
#   3) plink, sensibly enough given win32's limitations, uses two threads to
#      simultaneously read and write stdin and stdout. But if stdin and stdout
#      refer to the same socket, then this counts as "overlapped IO", which
#      requires that WSA_FLAG_OVERLAPPED *is* set. (Thanks to Simon Tatham for
#      helping me figure this out.)
# Anyway, for all thse reasons, we make two different sockets, one for stdin
# and one for stdout. And for consistency, we do the same on POSIX.
#
# But, reading and writing from the same socket is kind of a pain on win32
# because you can only have one IO watch active per socket:
#     http://faq.pygtk.org/index.py?req=all#20.20
# Yet, sometimes we have to have just one socket, when we're making a
# direct connection, over TCP or Unix domain. So then we have to manage that
# one socket consistently too.
#
# This class abstracts away the win32 nonsense about whether our read socket
# and write socket are actually the same:
