NOTE:

This project is in deep hibernation -- I haven't had any time to devote to it for several years now.

If you're looking for xpra, "screen for X", then this is the original repository -- but you probably
want to instead check out the fork at http://xpra.org

Original README follows.

Parti project README
====================

Hi, welcome to Parti.  The overall goal of this project is to create a
modern, tabbing/tiling window manager.  It got a little distracted, so
now there are actually three conceptually-independent projects in this
tree:

wimpiggy: A library for writing window managers, used by both of the
  next two items.

parti: The above-mentioned window manager, currently in
  proof-of-concept form.

xpra: "X Persistent Remote Applications" -- think 'screen for X'.
  Currently beta status.

See the README.<project> for more details about each.
